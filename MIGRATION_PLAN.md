# C&C Project Manager - Migration to Azure SQL

## Overview
Migrating from SharePoint as database to Azure SQL + Azure Functions + Web PubSub for reliable, fast, real-time task management.

## Architecture

```
Frontend (React) 
    â†“
Azure Functions (API)
    â†“ (Managed Identity)
Azure SQL Database
    â†“
Web PubSub (Real-time events)
```

## Step-by-Step Migration

### Phase 1: Database Setup âœ…
- [x] Create Azure SQL Database schema
- [ ] Deploy SQL database to Azure
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up Managed Identity for Functions

### Phase 2: API Development
- [ ] Create Azure Functions project structure
- [ ] Implement CRUD endpoints:
  - GET /api/tasks (with filters)
  - POST /api/tasks
  - PUT /api/tasks/:id
  - DELETE /api/tasks/:id
- [ ] Implement recurrence generation logic
- [ ] Add authentication middleware
- [ ] Implement search and filtering

### Phase 3: Real-time Setup
- [ ] Set up Azure Web PubSub
- [ ] Configure publish/subscribe channels
- [ ] Implement real-time update events:
  - task.created
  - task.updated
  - task.deleted
  - task.completed

### Phase 4: Data Migration
- [ ] Export current SharePoint data
- [ ] Transform data to SQL schema
- [ ] Import into Azure SQL
- [ ] Validate data integrity

### Phase 5: Frontend Updates
- [ ] Replace SharePoint service with Azure Functions client
- [ ] Update all data fetching
- [ ] Implement WebSocket connection
- [ ] Update UI to use real-time updates
- [ ] Remove SharePoint dependencies

### Phase 6: Deployment & Testing
- [ ] Deploy Functions to Azure
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Test end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Monitor performance

## Benefits

### âœ… Reliability
- **ACID transactions** - No more duplicate issues
- **Data integrity** - Foreign keys and constraints
- **Backup & restore** - Point-in-time recovery

### âš¡ Performance
- **Fast queries** - Optimized indexes
- **Minimal latency** - Direct database access
- **Scalable** - Serverless option available

### ðŸ”„ Real-time
- **Instant updates** - WebSocket push notifications
- **Multi-device sync** - All devices see changes immediately
- **No polling** - No wasted bandwidth

### ðŸŽ¯ Flexibility
- **Your schema** - Design it how you want
- **Your API** - Full control over endpoints
- **Your logic** - No SharePoint constraints

## Costs (Estimated)
- Azure SQL Database (Serverless S0): ~$15-30/month
- Azure Functions (Consumption): ~$5-20/month
- Web PubSub (Free tier): $0/month for < 100 concurrent connections
- **Total: ~$20-50/month** (much cheaper than problems with SharePoint)

## Security
- Azure AD authentication (keep your Microsoft integration)
- Managed Identity (no connection strings in code)
- Key Vault for secrets
- Firewall rules for database access

## Timeline
- Phase 1-2: 2-3 days
- Phase 3-4: 1-2 days  
- Phase 5: 2-3 days
- Phase 6: 1 day
- **Total: ~1 week** to fully migrate

## Next Steps
1. I can start implementing Azure Functions endpoints
2. Set up the database migration script
3. Update your React frontend to use the new API

**Ready to start?** Let me know and I'll begin implementing the Functions API!
