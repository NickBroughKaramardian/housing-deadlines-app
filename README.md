# Housing Deadlines App

A comprehensive project management application for handling housing-related deadlines and tasks with advanced recurring task support.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as urgent
- **Batch Entry**: Import multiple tasks via table entry or spreadsheet upload (CSV/XLSX)
- **Advanced Sorting & Filtering**: Sort by deadline, responsible party, project, recurring status, urgent status, or search across multiple fields

### Recurring Tasks (NEW!)
The app now features **intelligent recurring task expansion** that automatically generates all individual instances of recurring deadlines:

- **Search & Filter Integration**: All expanded instances appear in search results and filters

#### Example
If you create a monthly recurring task from 2024-2026:
- **Original Task**: "Monthly Report" due 2024-01-15, recurring monthly until 2026
- **Expanded Instances**: 36 individual tasks (12 per year Ã— 3 years)
