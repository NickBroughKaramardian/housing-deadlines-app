# üïê Setting Up While Azure Portal is Down

## What We Can Do Right Now (Without Azure Portal)

### 1. ‚úÖ Install Dependencies
```bash
# We already did this - Azure CLI is installed!
az --version
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Prepare Your Code
- All the Azure Functions code is ready
- Database schema is ready
- Migration script is ready

### 3. ‚úÖ Test Locally
We can test the database connection and migration script locally once Azure comes back online.

## Once Azure Portal is Back Up

We'll be able to:
1. Create the resources via Azure CLI (might work even if portal doesn't)
2. Run the setup commands
3. Deploy everything

## Try This Command (Sometimes CLI Works When Portal Doesn't)

When Azure is back up, try:
```bash
az login
az account list  # See if you have any subscriptions
```

If you can see subscriptions via CLI, we might be able to create everything via command line even if the portal is still down!
